# Overview

## Introduction

NFTSy Protocol (where Sy stands for synthetic) is an NFT derivatives protocol for blue-chip NFT collections. Our mission is to power the financialization of NFTs by making NFT investments more accessible and agile.

For each NFT collection, NFTSy issues synthetic tokens (ERC 20) tracking the floor price of the collection (BAYC, Azuki, etc.). Each synthetic token being minted is backed by either ETH or NFTs from the underlying NFT collection. Users can take long and short positions on synthetic tokens without having to hold the underlying NFT.
